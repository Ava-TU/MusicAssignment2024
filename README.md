# MusicAssignment2024
I have chosen to do a soundboard for this assignment and it's name is:
# Drum Kit Soundboard (or Drum!)
The project consists of various buttons that play different unique sounds and sliders that can be used the adjust the volume/pitch of some buttons.
The whole point of this Godot project is to mess around with the buttons and sliders to see what kind of beat you can make with the chaos.
